# VetMed
This is a Senior Capstone project in which we developed a functional prototype website for a local business. The resulting product, is a Windows Forms application built in C# that manages veterinary records. The application is currently a prototype, but it is fully functional and ready for deployment if chosen to be adopted. 

Features include managing patient and appointment records, two factor authentication through Twilio, the use of local databases to store data, and environmental variables for secure credential storage. Twilio account credentials have been omitted for security reasons. The code includes placeholders to allow users to add their own account information as needed.)
